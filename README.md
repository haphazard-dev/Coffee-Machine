# Coffee-Machine
First Kotlin project I worked on at JetBrains Academy

This project is supposed to be a simple loop of actions. 
You can buy three different types of coffee, fill the machine's ingredients, take the money from the machine, find how much of each ingredient is left, and end the program.

Eventually, I plan on returning to this program to utilize more of what I've learned about Kotlin to see if I can make the program more efficient.
